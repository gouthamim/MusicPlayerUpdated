        <item>Abhi mujh mein kahin
Baaqi thodi si hai zindagi
Jagi dhadkan nayi
Jaana zinda hoon main toh abhi
Kuch aisi lagan iss lamhe mein hai
Ye lamha kahaan tha mera
Ab hai saamne
Issey chhoo loon zaraa
Mar jaaoon ya jee loon zaraa
Khushiyaan choom loon
Yaa ro loo\’n zaraa
Mar jaaun ya jee loon zaraa

Ho o.. abhi mujh mein kahin
Baaqi thodi si hai zindagi

Ho.. dhoop mein jalte huey tann ko
Chhaya perh ki mill gayee
Roothe bachche ki hansi jaise
Phuslaane se phir khill gayee
Kuchh aisa hi abb mehsoos dil ko ho rahaa hai
Barso\’n ke purane zakhm pe marham laga sa hai
Kuch aisa rahem, iss lamhe mein hai
Ye lamha kahaan tha mera
Ab hai saamne
Issey chhoo loon zara
Mar jaaoon ya jee loon zara
Khushiyaan choom loon
Yaa ro loo\’n zaraa
Mar jaaoo\’n yaa jee loon zaraa

Dor se tooti patang jaisi, thi ye zindagani meri
Aaj ho kal ho mera naa ho
Har din thi kahani meri
Ik bandhan naya peechhe se abb mujhko bulaaye
Aane waley kal ki kyun fikar mujhko sata jaaye
Ik aisi chubhan iss lamhe me hai
Ye lamha kahaan tha mera aa
Ab hai saamne
Issey chhoo loon zara
Mar jaaoo\’n ya jee loon zara
Khushiyaan choom loon
Yaa ro loo\’n zaraa
Mar jaaoo\’n ya jee loon zara</item>
        <item>You\'re way too beautiful girl
That\'s why it\'ll never work
You\'ll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it\'s over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They\'ll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it\'s over

See it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh when you took my heart
That\'s when we fell apart
Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever (lasts forever)
They say we\'re too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn\'t care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn\'t last together (last together)

See it\'s very define girl,
One of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You have to get declined
Oh Lord...
My baby is driving me crazy

It was back in \'99
Watchin\' movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doin\' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I\'m with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn\'t the girl for me (girl for me)

Now we\'re fussin\'
And now we\'re fightin\'
Please tell me why
I\'m feelin\' slighted
And I don\'t know
How to make it better (make it better)
You\'re datin\' other guys
You\'re tellin\' me lies
Oh I can\'t believe
What I\'m seein\' with my eyes
I\'m losin\' my mind
And I don\'t think it\'s clever (think it\'s clever)</item>
        <item>Har pal meriyaan yadaan
Yadaan vich ae tun
Dil di gal main dassa
Te dassa fir kinnu (x2)

Teri meri, meri teri ik jind\’di
Ik jind\’di what to do
Jhoomu main naachu main gaaun ke likhun
Tere liye main kya karun

Dheere dheere se meri zindagi mein aana
Dheere dheere se dil ko churana (churana..)
Tumse pyaar hume hai kitna jaane jaana
Tumse mil kar tumko hai batana

Sham wahi, kaam wahi
Tere bina o sanam
Neend nahi, chain nahi
Tere bina o sanam (x2)

Teri meri, meri teri ik jind\’di
Ik jind\’di what to do?
Jhoomu main nachu main gaaun ke likhun
Tere liye main kya karun

Dheere dheere se meri zindagi mein aana
Dheere dheere se dil ko churana (churana..)
Tumse pyaar hume hai kitna jaane jaana
Tumse milkar tumko hai batana (x2)

Yo Yo Honey Singh Rap
Teri meri story jaise Big Bang Theory
Main sunaun chori-chori ye sab ko
Tu mujhse door main yahan pe majboor
Shikva karun main ye Rabb ko (Rabb ko..)
Ek din tum bin beete lage saal
Mera hua bura haal
Mera hua bura haal
Haal kabhi apna mujhe to bataao na
Aur laut kar wapas kabhi mere paas aao na

Sota hoon kabhi rota hoon
Tere bina o sanam
Paa kar sab kuch khota hoon
Tere bina o sanam (x2)

Teri meri meri teri ik jind\’di
Ik jind\’di what to do?
Jhoomu main naachun gaaun ke likhun
Tere liye main kya karun

Dheere dheere se meri zindagi mein aana
Dheere dheere se dil ko churana (churana..)
Tumse pyaar humein hai kitna jaan-e-jaana
Tumse mil kar tumko hai batana

Tumse mil kar tumko hai batana
Tumse mil kar tumko hai batana</item>
        <item>Lonely, I\'m Mr. Lonely,
I have nobody for my own
I\'m so lonely, I\'m Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I\'m so lonely.

Yo this one here goes out to all my players out there, man, ya know
that got that one good girl who\'s always been there, man, like took all the bullshit
then one day she can\'t take it no more and decide to leave

I woke up in the middle of the night
and I noticed my girl wasn\'t by my side,
coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feenin,
so I had to take a little ride,
back tracking over these few years,
tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad,
Cause ever since my girl left me my whole life came crashing

I\'m so lonely (so lonely),
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Can\'t believe I had a girl like you
and I just let you walk right outta my life,
after all I put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side,
what really hurt me is I broke your heart,
baby, you were a good girl and I had no right,
I really wanna make things right,
Cause without you in my life girl

I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Been all about the world ain\'t never met a girl
that can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
and I would be out chasing you
Cause ain\'t nowhere in the globe I\'d rather be,
ain\'t no one in the globe I\'d rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be
so happy but now so lonely

So lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own)
I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Never thought that I\'d be alone,
I didn\'t think you\'d be gone this long,
I just want you to call my phone,
so stop playing girl and come on home (come on home),
baby girl, I didn\'t mean to shout,
I want me and you to work it out,
I never wished I\'d ever hurt my baby,
and it\'s driving me crazy
Cause...

I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own)
I\'m so lonely (so lonely)
I\'m Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, (so lonely),
Mr. Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely (so lonely), Mr. Lonely</item>
        <item>Today I don\'t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don\'t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
            Cause today I swear I\'m not doing anything

Uh I\'m gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the t.v. on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody\'s gon tell me I cant, no

I\'ll be loungin on the couch just chillin in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
Cause in my castle I\'m the freakin man
Oh

Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cause I can
Today I don\'t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don\'t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I\'m not doing anything

Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh

Tomorrow I\'ll wake up do some
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she\'s gonna scream out this is great

I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops you\'ll just have to wait
Oh

Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cause I can

Today I don\'t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don\'t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I\'m not doing anything

No I ain\'t gonna comb my hair
Cause I ain\'t goin anywhere
No no no no no no no no no oh
I\'ll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, today I don\'t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don\'t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I\'m not doing anything

Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all</item>
        <item>Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It\'s perfect, it\'s passion, it\'s setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I\'ve cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I\'ve dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
</item><item>Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall
My mind is running wild trying hard not to fall
You tell me that you love me but say I\'m just a friend
My heart is broken up into pieces
Cause I know I\'ll never free my soul
It\'s trapped in between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Why oh why tell me why not me
Why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why

I wanna love you
If you only knew how much I love you
So why not me

The day after tomorrow I\'ll still be around
To catch you when you fall and never let you down
You say that we\'re forever our love will never end
I\'ve tried to come up but it\'s drowning me to know
You\'ll never feel my soul
It\'s trapped in between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Tell me baby...

You won\'t ever know
How far we can go (go)
You won\'t ever know
How far we can go (go)

(why not me, why not me, why not me)</item>
